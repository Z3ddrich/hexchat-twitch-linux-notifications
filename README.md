# hexchat-twitch-linux-notifications

I wanted to create a new way for myself as a linux gamer to stream fullscreen and monitor twitch chat.  My distro used hexchat, so I wrote this script by default.  I wanted to post this on github so others might benefit from this as well.

It should work on MAC OS and Windows provided you have python and hexchat installed, although I have no way of testing that.

Simply place this file in your hexchat/addons directories and load the script with your chat channel open in hexchat.
